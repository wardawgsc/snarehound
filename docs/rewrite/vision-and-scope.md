# Vision and Scope

SnareHound v2 is a desktop-first, contract-driven system with three separated concerns:
- local Windows agent for game integration,
- backend for policy/auth/webhook dispatch,
- modern UI for operator workflows.

## Primary outcomes
- Better reliability through modular architecture.
- Universal UI design capability via modern frontend stack.
- Secure member-gated Discord push operations.

## Out of scope (MVP)
- Full cloud multi-tenancy.
- Mobile client.
- Plugin marketplace.
